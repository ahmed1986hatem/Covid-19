2
00:00:02.854 --> 00:00:04.063
Good afternoon.

3
00:00:04.063 --> 00:00:07.280
We are here today with Professor
Neil Ferguson director of J-Idea,

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.670
talking about the current
Corona virus outbreak.

5
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.787
Welcome.

6
00:00:10.787 --> 00:00:12.370
Thank you for
taking the time to speak with us.

7
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.985
Would you be able to give
us an update on the current

8
00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:17.678
estimates that you're
working on with your team?

9
00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:20.709
>> So the main things we're
working on currently are trying

10
00:00:20.709 --> 00:00:23.739
to get a better handle on really
how lethal this virus is,

11
00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.221
what threat it poses to
the human population.

12
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:29.229
It's a difficult thing
to do in an epidemic,

13
00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:33.110
because just simply looking at
how many people have died so

14
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.321
far, this is how many cases there are,
tells you very little.

15
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:41.906
It takes quite a long time often for
somebody people from being diagnosed as

16
00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:45.835
a case to actually worry whether
we know they're going to live or

17
00:00:45.835 --> 00:00:47.383
survive the infection.

18
00:00:47.383 --> 00:00:48.882
So we're trying to correct for

19
00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:52.182
those factors in terms of look at
the overall scale of the epidemic.

20
00:00:52.182 --> 00:00:54.372
We're going to kind of firmer estimates.

21
00:00:54.372 --> 00:01:00.826
What we can say is surveillance ongoing
in China is we're probably picking up

22
00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:06.004
you think of all infections out
there being a kind of pyramid.

23
00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:08.708
It picks up the top of the pyramid,
the most severe infection.

24
00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:10.609
We think probably 10% or

25
00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:15.579
less of all infections in China
are being detected at the current time.

26
00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.229
The next tier down is really
what's been detected overseas.

27
00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.125
With there we think sensitivity
is somewhat higher, but

28
00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:27.123
still we may be only detecting maybe
a quarter of all infections of that level.

29
00:01:27.123 --> 00:01:31.147
Lots of people will be entering
in that borders are porous,

30
00:01:31.147 --> 00:01:34.773
countries won't be detecting
every case coming in.

31
00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:39.330
>> Would you be able to say anything about
forward projections of where the current

32
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.493
outbreak is going?

33
00:01:40.493 --> 00:01:44.028
>> Well, in terms of where we
think the current outbreak has

34
00:01:44.028 --> 00:01:45.583
got to in terms of scale.

35
00:01:45.583 --> 00:01:51.113
We estimate that maybe up to 50,000 new
infections a day occurring in China,

36
00:01:51.113 --> 00:01:55.616
which is obviously much larger than
the official case numbers, and

37
00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:57.524
it's going up all the time.

38
00:01:57.524 --> 00:02:04.346
So the forward projections depend really
on the effectiveness of control measures.

39
00:02:04.346 --> 00:02:07.986
We think the epidemic is roughly doubling
in size about every five days at

40
00:02:07.986 --> 00:02:08.948
the current time.

41
00:02:08.948 --> 00:02:13.045
It's hard to evaluate how
effective controls are, but

42
00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:16.891
there's limited evidence
of its slowing in China.

43
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:21.788
Under that scenario, with the epidemic
would really follow a natural course

44
00:02:21.788 --> 00:02:26.020
probably peak in its epicenter,
Wuhan in around a month's time.

45
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.632
Some uncertainty around that,
and then maybe a month or

46
00:02:28.632 --> 00:02:30.143
two later in the whole of China.

47
00:02:30.143 --> 00:02:34.396
The rest of the world will see
epidemics at various times after that,

48
00:02:34.396 --> 00:02:38.883
depending on how well connected they
are have been in the past few weeks.

49
00:02:38.883 --> 00:02:43.143
So many travelers come to them
who infected from China itself.

50
00:02:43.143 --> 00:02:46.526
As to the overall effectiveness
of control measures,

51
00:02:46.526 --> 00:02:51.315
it's hard to evaluate if there's a lot
of community transmission going on.

52
00:02:51.315 --> 00:02:52.899
We think there probably is,

53
00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:56.595
it will be very hard to control this
epidemic in the same way, as for

54
00:02:56.595 --> 00:03:00.491
instance we controlled the SARS
epidemic some 15, 20 years ago.

55
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:05.408
>> Would you be able to explain how
the mathematical modeling that your

56
00:03:05.408 --> 00:03:09.643
team is doing can inform policy and
government response?

57
00:03:09.643 --> 00:03:11.536
>> Yeah, so statistical and

58
00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:16.362
mathematical analysis of epidemic
data has quite a long history.

59
00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:20.890
And it's really been come quite
established within the policy framework

60
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.689
obviously making framework used
particularly in the UK, but

61
00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:26.086
a bit further afield.

62
00:03:26.086 --> 00:03:30.867
And that's because often what we have is
very noisy and limited data in early in

63
00:03:30.867 --> 00:03:35.955
an outbreak, and we want to be able to get
the most information from that possible.

64
00:03:35.955 --> 00:03:38.654
So advanced kind of statistical modeling,
and

65
00:03:38.654 --> 00:03:43.180
then later can mechanistic transmission
modeling can be useful in doing that.

66
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.029
So simple questions we try to answer
is how transmissible is a new pathogen?

67
00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:50.285
How long has it been circulating?

68
00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:54.903
How much occasion cases are always
underestimated in every epidemic and

69
00:03:54.903 --> 00:03:57.637
surveillance is never 100% perfect.

70
00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:59.774
So how large is the real epidemic?

71
00:03:59.774 --> 00:04:04.619
And then critically important
to how people respond is is how

72
00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:08.424
severe a threat does this
pose to human health?

73
00:04:08.424 --> 00:04:12.130
>> Would you be able to explain
a little bit about the uncertainty

74
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.921
ranges around the estimates
that you report?

75
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:18.157
>> So uncertainty is always
high early in a epidemic,

76
00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:21.555
particularly of a disease
we've never seen before.

77
00:04:21.555 --> 00:04:24.468
We don't know a thing,
critical things like how long it takes

78
00:04:24.468 --> 00:04:27.496
from when somebody's infected
to when they develop symptoms,

79
00:04:27.496 --> 00:04:31.215
something called incubation period we
don't have transmissible diseases.

80
00:04:31.215 --> 00:04:34.907
So we try to estimate these things
from quite limited data, and

81
00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:39.855
the limited data means that there's always
uncertainty in estimates which we try to

82
00:04:39.855 --> 00:04:43.777
characterize using state-of-the-art
statistical methods.

83
00:04:43.777 --> 00:04:48.973
So often we will quote something,
like we think every case generates 2.6

84
00:04:48.973 --> 00:04:53.777
other cases on average,
something called the reproduction number.

85
00:04:53.777 --> 00:04:58.347
There will be a range around that might
vary from anywhere between 2.1 up to

86
00:04:58.347 --> 00:04:59.693
3.3 or something.

87
00:04:59.693 --> 00:05:04.822
And that captures how much we
know about that information,

88
00:05:04.822 --> 00:05:08.422
that particular parameter of interest.

89
00:05:08.422 --> 00:05:13.460
>> And then with that uncertainty range
how useful is there to inform policies and

90
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.463
governments?

91
00:05:14.463 --> 00:05:18.718
>> So generally policymakers would
like everything to be certain.

92
00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:23.362
So handling uncertainty is a challenge.

93
00:05:23.362 --> 00:05:27.298
I think the uncertainty range tells them
what confidence we have in the estimate,

94
00:05:27.298 --> 00:05:28.964
if we have calculated correctly.

95
00:05:28.964 --> 00:05:34.606
So if we for instance say, well, the case
fatality ratio, the proportion of people

96
00:05:34.606 --> 00:05:39.930
who might die in an outbreak varies,
could be anywhere from one in 1,000,

97
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.998
the one in ten that's not
a terribly informative estimate.

98
00:05:43.998 --> 00:05:51.148
If we can say precisely the estimate is
1% case fatality, 1% of people will die.

99
00:05:51.148 --> 00:05:52.967
It could be half a percent,
it could be 2%.

100
00:05:52.967 --> 00:05:53.892
That's a much more useful estimate.

101
00:05:53.892 --> 00:05:58.872
>> And do you have any suggestions as to
what the most efficient interventions

102
00:05:58.872 --> 00:06:02.914
would be at the moment for
either China or internationally?

103
00:06:02.914 --> 00:06:06.819
>> Unfortunately for
this virus we have limited options for

104
00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.348
interventions at the current time.

105
00:06:09.348 --> 00:06:13.062
We have no vaccine, their vaccines
are rapidly being developed and

106
00:06:13.062 --> 00:06:15.483
will take months, if not years to develop.

107
00:06:15.483 --> 00:06:17.897
Some testing of antiviral treatments,

108
00:06:17.897 --> 00:06:22.800
existing drugs being repurposed to see if
they work in infections in these cases.

109
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.536
The other measures we have to draw
upon are what are called Public Health

110
00:06:26.536 --> 00:06:27.415
intervention.

111
00:06:27.415 --> 00:06:32.506
So identifying as many cases as possible,
as early as possible in their disease and

112
00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:37.178
isolating them is how we managed to
control for instance the SARS outbreak.

113
00:06:37.178 --> 00:06:39.783
And genetically quite similar
virus to this new virus.

114
00:06:39.783 --> 00:06:44.416
Whether those measures will be
affecting as effective in this case

115
00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:45.829
remains to be seen.

116
00:06:45.829 --> 00:06:53.575
This virus has a much wider
range of severity of symptoms.

117
00:06:53.575 --> 00:06:57.248
Quite a lot of people being infected may
just have quite mild respiratory disease

118
00:06:57.248 --> 00:06:59.039
might not even seek healthcare for it.

119
00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:01.899
If those people
are transmitting then it will

120
00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:04.691
be very hard to stop transmission overall.

121
00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:08.407
So within the next few weeks
will really tell us about

122
00:07:08.407 --> 00:07:11.711
the likelihood of control
measures working.

123
00:07:11.711 --> 00:07:15.712
So in terms of interventions,
the Chinese have been throwing everything

124
00:07:15.712 --> 00:07:18.430
they can at this outbreak for
the last 32 weeks.

125
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.019
In terms of what might work that
critically depends on who is transmitting

126
00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:26.720
infection, and
whether the people who are responsible for

127
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.693
most onward transmission are being
identified and isolated are early enough.

128
00:07:31.693 --> 00:07:35.558
The Chinese are currently focusing
on identifying severe cases and

129
00:07:35.558 --> 00:07:40.112
isolating those, it's unclear whether
the mild cases left in the community.

130
00:07:40.112 --> 00:07:44.161
And we think that's the majority of cases
are still sustaining the outbreak or not.

131
00:07:44.161 --> 00:07:47.738
We'll know more in the next
couple of weeks at the moment.

132
00:07:47.738 --> 00:07:51.025
We can't see much evidence of
the epidemic slowing down.

133
00:07:51.025 --> 00:07:55.278
>> There have been few facilities
outside mainland China.

134
00:07:55.278 --> 00:07:57.810
Would you be able to explain why that is,

135
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.663
why we see their difference with the case
the fatalities that we see in China.

136
00:08:02.663 --> 00:08:07.473
>> So looking at the severity of
an epidemic, working out how many

137
00:08:07.473 --> 00:08:12.120
people might eventually die from it,
is very challenging.

138
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.959
There were delays quite often long delays
from when somebody is diagnosed with

139
00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.131
an affection, and

140
00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:22.915
may be reported in the media, for instance
in Thailand or Japan or Hong Kong.

141
00:08:22.915 --> 00:08:27.677
And when we finally know what the outcome
of that case is, people will persevere,

142
00:08:27.677 --> 00:08:30.587
cases will be intensive care,
maybe four weeks.

143
00:08:30.587 --> 00:08:34.401
We think the delay from when
somebody is developed symptoms

144
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:39.218
to when they might dies is as long as
20 days or longer, three weeks or so.

145
00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:42.780
So the fact we haven't seen
many deaths in travelers.

146
00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.389
We've seen two so far,

147
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:49.145
cases detective outside mainland
China is not terribly reassuring.

148
00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:51.204
We wouldn't have expected
to see very many so

149
00:08:51.204 --> 00:08:53.162
far because of those delays in the system.

150
00:08:53.162 --> 00:08:55.720
What we're trying to do now is account for

151
00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.481
those delays and do an accurate estimate
of how lethal we think this virus is.

152
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:03.223
>> How worried are you about
this current outbreak?

153
00:09:03.223 --> 00:09:05.754
The outbreak is clearly of concern.

154
00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:12.155
It's probably the most major, we call
it emerging infectious disease event.

155
00:09:12.155 --> 00:09:16.612
The world has seen since least since
the pandemic influenza in 2009 and

156
00:09:16.612 --> 00:09:19.236
maybe since the SARS outbreak in 2003.

157
00:09:19.236 --> 00:09:23.796
So we don't fully know enough to be
able to estimate the full scale of

158
00:09:23.796 --> 00:09:28.599
disease burden, we call it,
which will affect the human population.

159
00:09:28.599 --> 00:09:32.544
How many people will die, but
it's something that certainly governments

160
00:09:32.544 --> 00:09:36.809
need to prepare for urgently in terms of
ramping up health system preparedness.

161
00:09:36.809 --> 00:09:42.356
And in particular undertaking rapid
research to try to develop treatments

162
00:09:42.356 --> 00:09:47.381
which can reduce potentially
fatality in severe cases of disease.

163
00:09:47.381 --> 00:09:49.213
>> How is the work that you do funded?

164
00:09:49.213 --> 00:09:55.138
>> So the funding for the work we do
here comes from a number of sources.

165
00:09:55.138 --> 00:09:59.182
We are very fortunate to have
generous institute funding from

166
00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:03.939
Community Jamil to fund our work,
not just on responding to outbreaks.

167
00:10:03.939 --> 00:10:08.853
But much broader work on how the world
responds to other forms of health crisis

168
00:10:08.853 --> 00:10:11.131
due to climate change and the like.

169
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:16.169
We then receive a lot of research funding
from individual research funders,

170
00:10:16.169 --> 00:10:21.604
and so within J-Idea have the MRC Center
for Global Infectious Disease Analysis.

171
00:10:21.604 --> 00:10:25.049
Which has generous funding from
the UK Medical Research Council,

172
00:10:25.049 --> 00:10:28.074
received also a lot of funding
from other funders as well.

173
00:10:28.074 --> 00:10:31.861
>> Thank you for
taking the time to speak to us today.

174
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:32.660
>> It's a pleasure.

175
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.564
